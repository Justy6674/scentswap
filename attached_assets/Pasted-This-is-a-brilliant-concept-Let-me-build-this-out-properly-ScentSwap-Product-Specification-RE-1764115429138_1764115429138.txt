This is a brilliant concept. Let me build this out properly.

ScentSwap — Product Specification & README
The Vision
ScentSwap is Australia's first AI-powered fragrance bartering marketplace. No buying, no selling — just swapping. Trade that impulse buy sitting on your shelf for something you'll actually wear.
The fragrance community has a problem: people accumulate bottles they don't love, decants they've finished exploring, and blind buys that didn't work out. Selling is awkward, prices are disputed, and scammers lurk everywhere.
ScentSwap removes money from the equation entirely. Pure trade. AI-assisted matching. Verified users only. Fair swaps guaranteed.

Core Philosophy
1. No Money, No Drama — Swapping eliminates price haggling and payment scams
2. AI as the Neutral Party — The AI mediates fairness, suggests matches, verifies authenticity
3. Trust is Everything — Verification, ratings, and swap history build community trust
4. Australian First — Starting local means accountable users and reasonable shipping

How It Works — User Journey

2. Build Your Swap Cabinet

    * Select fragrance from database (auto-linked to Fragrantica)
    * Specify: size, fill level (%), batch code, condition
    * Add personal notes ("This one's a beast mode performer")
* AI auto-generates scent description, notes pyramid, and comparable fragrances
3. Set Your Swap Preferences
* For each listing, specify what you'd accept:
    * Specific fragrances you're hunting
    * Or broader preferences: designer/niche, gender, scent family, season
    * Swap ratio flexibility: 1:1, 1:2, 1:3 (based on relative value)
    * Willing to add decants to balance a trade?

The Swap Fairness Algorithm
Not all bottles are equal. A 10ml decant isn't worth a 100ml full presentation. The AI calculates:
Factors:
* Current market value (scraped from Fragrantica, Facebook groups, auction sites)
* Bottle size
* Fill level percentage
* Condition (new/like new/good/fair)
* Rarity/discontinuation status
* Batch desirability (some batches more sought after)
* Age (vintage value vs. degradation)
Output:
* Swap Value Score for each item
* Comparison showing if trade is balanced
* Suggestions to balance if not: "Add a 10ml decant of X to make this fair"
User Override:
* Users can accept "unfair" swaps knowingly
* System flags but doesn't block
* "I know this isn't equal value but I really want this bottle" — fine, proceed

Overall	Would you swap with them again?

* Can dispute unfair ratings with evidence
