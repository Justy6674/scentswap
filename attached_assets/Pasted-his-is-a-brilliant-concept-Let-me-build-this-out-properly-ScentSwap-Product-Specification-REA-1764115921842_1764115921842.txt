his is a brilliant concept. Let me build this out properly.

ScentSwap — Product Specification & README
The Vision
ScentSwap is Australia's first AI-powered fragrance bartering marketplace. No buying, no selling — just swapping. Trade that impulse buy sitting on your shelf for something you'll actually wear.
The fragrance community has a problem: people accumulate bottles they don't love, decants they've finished exploring, and blind buys that didn't work out. Selling is awkward, prices are disputed, and scammers lurk everywhere.
ScentSwap removes money from the equation entirely. Pure trade. AI-assisted matching. Verified users only. Fair swaps guaranteed.

Core Philosophy
1. No Money, No Drama — Swapping eliminates price haggling and payment scams
2. AI as the Neutral Party — The AI mediates fairness, suggests matches, verifies authenticity
3. Trust is Everything — Verification, ratings, and swap history build community trust
4. Australian First — Starting local means accountable users and reasonable shipping

The Swap Fairness Algorithm
Not all bottles are equal. A 10ml decant isn't worth a 100ml full presentation. The AI calculates:
Factors:
* Current market value (scraped from Fragrantica, Facebook groups, auction sites)
* Bottle size
* Fill level percentage
* Condition (new/like new/good/fair)
* Rarity/discontinuation status
* Batch desirability (some batches more sought after)
* Age (vintage value vs. degradation)
Output:
* Swap Value Score for each item
* Comparison showing if trade is balanced
* Suggestions to balance if not: "Add a 10ml decant of X to make this fair"
User Override:
* Users can accept "unfair" swaps knowingly
* System flags but doesn't block
* "I know this isn't equal value but I really want this bottle" — fine, proceed

Shipping & Handling
Mandatory Packing Protocol:
1. Secure the spray nozzle (tape or remove)
2. Wrap bottle in bubble wrap (minimum 2 layers)
3. Place in rigid box with padding (no movement when shaken)
4. Seal outer box securely
5. Photograph packed item before sealing
6. Upload photo to swap record

Gemini
This is the Master Blueprint. It combines a rigorous Investor-Grade Business Case with a Technical Product Requirements Document (PRD) designed specifically for an AI Agent (Cursor/Claude) to ingest and build from.
You can feed this entire document to Cursor as your "Context File" (scentswap_master_plan.md).


MASTER DOCUMENT: SCENTSWAP

Version: 1.0
Context: Australia-First, AI-Powered Fragrance Trading Platform
Tech Stack: Cursor (Builder), Supabase (Backend), Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Intelligence)


PART 1: THE BUSINESS CASE

For Investors, Partners, and Strategic Clarity

1. Executive Summary

ScentSwap is a peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace app dedicated to the cashless trading of fragrances in Australia. It unlocks the liquidity of millions of dollars worth of "dead stock" (unused perfume bottles) sitting in consumers' homes.
Unlike generic platforms (eBay, Gumtree) or chaotic social channels (Facebook Groups), ScentSwap uses AI Verification and a proprietary Fairness Algorithm to eliminate scams, price haggling, and authenticity fears. We are not facilitating sales; we are facilitating upgrades to a user's collection.

2. The Market Opportunity (Australia Specific)

* The "Juice" Economy: The Australian fragrance market is valued at over $850M AUD annually.
* The Pain Point: Fragrances are non-refundable once opened. A "blind buy" (buying without smelling) that costs $250 and is disliked becomes a sunk cost.
* Current Solution Failure:
    * Facebook: 80% of trades fail due to trust issues ("You ship first," "No, you ship first").
    * eBay: Prohibitive fees (13%+) and "Used Cosmetics" policies restrict sales.
    * Forums: Archaic interfaces, low liquidity.

3. The Solution: "Trust-as-a-Service"

ScentSwap offers a walled garden for traders.
1. AI Authentication: Computer vision analyzes bottle geometry, liquid color, and batch codes against a master database to flag counterfeits.
2. The Fairness Engine: Users don't haggle over dollars. The AI analyzes the trade (e.g., User A's 50ml Tom Ford vs. User B's 100ml Versace) and assigns a "Fairness Score" (e.g., 94% Fair).
3. Identity Locking: Australian ID verification (Drivers License/Medicare) ensures that if a user scams, they are banned for life.

4. Revenue Model (Monetization)

Since swaps are cashless, we monetize access, data, and convenience.
* Free Tier: 1 active swap slot, standard listing visibility.
* ScentSwap NOIR (Premium - $9.99/mo):
    * Unlimited simultaneous swaps.
    * "Batch Hunter": Alert when a specific vintage batch (e.g., Aventus 2016) is listed.
    * Zero-Ads.
    * Insured Shipping: Integration with insurance partners for loss/breakage.
* "Boost" Micro-transactions: $2.99 to pin a listing to the top of the feed for 48 hours.

5. SWOT Analysis

Strengths (Internal)	Weaknesses (Internal)
First Mover: No dedicated app exists in AU.	Logistics: Perfume is "Dangerous Goods" (Class 3 Flammable). Shipping is road-only and slower.
Tech Moat: The "Fairness Algorithm" reduces social friction.	Cold Start: A marketplace needs liquidity (users) to function.
Opportunities (External)	Threats (External)
Retail Partnerships: "Try before you buy" integration with Libertine/Mecca.	Facebook Marketplace: If they introduce verified niche categories.
Decant Market: Legitimizing the trade of 5ml/10ml sample vials.	Counterfeits: Super-fakes are getting harder to spot (requires constant AI training).
6. Legal & Compliance (Australia)

1. Consumer Law: Clarify in T&Cs that ScentSwap is a platform, not a retailer. Swaps are "as-is" between private individuals.
2. Hazmat Shipping: The app must force "Road Transport Only" labels via API (Shippit or AusPost) to comply with Australian transport laws.
3. Data Privacy: ID data (GreenID/Stripe Identity) must be tokenized and never stored on our raw DB.


PART 2: PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)

For Cursor (AI Agent) & Development

1. System Architecture

* Frontend: React Native (Expo) - Cross-platform, fast build.
* Backend: Supabase
    * Database: PostgreSQL
    * Auth: Phone Auth + Social Login
    * Storage: Buckets for high-res user images
    * Edge Functions: For the "Fairness Calculator" logic
* AI Integration:
    * Vision: OpenAI GPT-4o Vision (for bottle analysis).
    * Logic: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (for chat mediation and fairness scoring).

2. Database Schema (Supabase Structure)

Prompt for Cursor: "Create these tables in Supabase via SQL Editor"
* users: (UUID, Phone, Reputation_Score, Verification_Level, Subscription_Tier)
* inventory_items: (Item_ID, User_ID, Brand, Product_Name, Batch_Code, Bottle_Size_ML, Fill_Level_Percent, Condition_Rating, Images_JSON)
* swaps: (Swap_ID, Initiator_ID, Receiver_ID, Initiator_Items[], Receiver_Items[], Status [Pending, Accepted, Locked, Shipped, Completed, Disputed], Fairness_Score)
* messages: (Chat_ID, Sender_ID, Content, Is_AI_Mediated_Boolean)
* brands_ref: (Reference table of brands for autocomplete)

3. Core Features (The "Epics")


Epic A: The Smart Cabinet (Inventory)

User Story: "As a user, I want to upload a photo of my perfume and have the app recognize it."
AI Logic:
1. User snaps photo.
2. AI analyzes image -> Extracts Text (OCR) for Brand/Name.
3. AI estimates Fill_Level (e.g., "Liquid line is at 60% height").
4. User confirms details.
5. Optimization: User enters "Batch Code." AI checks CheckFresh or CosmeticCalculator logic to display "Manufactured: Feb 2019" (Vintage value).

Epic B: The Fairness Engine (The "Brain")

User Story: "As a user, I want to know if I am getting ripped off."
Algorithm Logic:
The AI calculates a Trade_Points score for every item.

$$Points = (MarketPrice \times FillLevel) \times (DemandMultiplier) \times (VintageMultiplier)$$
* Example:
    * Dior Sauvage ($200 RRP) x 50% Full = $100 base value.
    * Demand is High (1.2x multiplier) = 120 Points.
* The Swap Check:
    * If User A offers 120 Points and User B offers 115 Points -> Green Light (Fair).
    * If User A offers 120 Points and User B offers 60 Points -> Red Light (Unbalanced).
    * AI Suggestion: "This trade is unbalanced. Ask User B to add a 10ml decant or pay for shipping."

Epic C: The Negotiation Room (Chat)

User Story: "As a user, I want to negotiate without hostility."
Feature: AI Mediator.
* The chat has a bot participant (@ScentBot).
* If a user types: "Is this authentic?", @ScentBot analyzes the photo metadata and seller history to give a confidence score.
* If a user types: "Address?", @ScentBot blocks the message and warns: "Addresses are only shared once the Swap is LOCKED."

Epic D: The Handshake (Transaction Flow)

1. Proposal: User A selects items to swap.
2. Lock: User B accepts. Inventory is "Frozen" (cannot be offered elsewhere).
3. Logistics: App generates unique Swap ID.
    * AU Optimization: Integration with Sendle/AusPost API. Users pay $10 flat rate shipping in-app. Labels are generated automatically.
4. Verification: When received, User B snaps a photo of the unboxing. AI validates item condition matches the listing.
5. Completion: Swap marked complete. Reputation points awarded.
6. ￼
7.  Shutterstock  Explore   

4. UI/UX Guidelines

* Visual Style: "Dark Mode" luxury aesthetic (Think: Tom Ford packaging). Gold accents, crisp white text, deep black backgrounds.
* Navigation:
    * Home: Feed of recent listings (Tinder-style swipe for "Want").
    * Search: Filter by Brand, Note (e.g., "Oud", "Vanilla"), Season.
    * Cabinet: Manage my inventory.
    * Inbox: Active negotiations.

5. Security & Anti-Fraud (Crucial)

* Image Hashing: Prevent users from stealing Google Images. AI checks for duplicate image hashes on upload.
* "Proof of Life": Randomly ask high-risk sellers to take a photo of the bottle next to a piece of paper with today's date + their username.


PART 3: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE (For You)


Phase 1: The "Cursor" Prompt Strategy

To build this, open Cursor and use the "Composer" (Cmd+I). Paste the sections of the PRD above sequentially.
Step 1: Database Setup
"I am building ScentSwap using Supabase. Please look at the 'Database Schema' section of my PRD. Write the SQL to create these tables, including Row Level Security (RLS) policies where users can only update their own inventory."
Step 2: The Core View
"Create a React Native screen called 'Cabinet'. It should allow a user to upload a photo. Use the OpenAI Vision API (mocked for now) to analyze the photo and auto-fill the Brand and Fill Level fields."
Step 3: The Algorithm
"Write a TypeScript function called calculateFairness. It should take two arrays of items (MyItems, TheirItems) and return a fairness percentage based on the logic in 'Epic B' of the PRD."

Phase 2: Refinements & Reality Checks

1. Start with Manual Pricing: Don't try to build a dynamic price scraper on Day 1. Hardcode prices for the top 50 brands (Dior, Chanel, Creed, etc.) in a JSON file.
2. Manual Verification: In the MVP, you (the admin) should manually approve the first 100 verifications to train the AI on what Australian ID cards look like.


Actionable Next Step

Would you like me to generate the actual JSON dataset of the top 50 Fragrance Brands + their Base Market Values? You can plug this straight into your Supabase database so the "Fairness Engine" works immediately upon launch.

SCENTSWAP — Full Business Case, Investor-Ready

Executive Summary

ScentSwap is Australia’s first dedicated AI-powered fragrance swapping marketplace — a safer, more intelligent, and more community-driven alternative to Facebook groups, Gumtree, eBay, or random Instagram deals.

The concept eliminates money entirely.
No prices.
No haggling.
No scams.
Just verified Australians trading fragrances using an AI fairness engine and identity verification.

The value proposition is simple:

Australians have millions of dollars in unused fragrance sitting on shelves.
ScentSwap unlocks that “dead” money and turns it into trading value.

⸻

The Problem (Real Market Pain)

1. Blind buys gone wrong

Australian fragrance buyers consistently overspend on fragrances they don’t end up loving. Thousands of bottles sit on shelves unused.

2. Selling is a pain

Selling a bottle is:
	•	awkward
	•	full of scammers
	•	price debates
	•	fake offers
	•	buyers ghosting
	•	dangerous meeting strangers
	•	expensive platform fees

3. No Australian-first trading platform

The fragrance community is massive, but trading still happens inside:
	•	Etsy
	•	eBay
	•	Marketplace
	•	Niche perfume FB groups
None of these are designed for fragrance swapping, authenticity checks, or AI fairness.

4. Trust is low

Scammers, fake bottles, and ghosters kill the experience.

⸻

Market Opportunity (Australia Only First)

1. Large fragrance spend

Australian fragrance market value 2024:
~$630 million annually
(Source: Statista industry data)

Blind buys + impulse buys represent a huge percentage.

2. High-energy niche fragrance community

FB groups with 20k–50k members each:
	•	Fragrance Enthusiasts Australia
	•	Australian Fragrance Swap Group
	•	Niche & Designer Fragrances AU
This community trades often; they just don’t have a platform.

3. TikTok + niche fragrance boom

Gen Z + Millennials are driving:
	•	Everyday hauls
	•	Decant culture
	•	“Test before you buy” movement
	•	Huge oversupply of unwanted bottles

4. No serious competitor

There is zero Australian-first fragrance swapping platform.

Facebook groups are the closest thing, but:
	•	no fraud control
	•	no AI fairness
	•	no verification
	•	inconsistent rules
	•	admin drama

ScentSwap becomes the dedicated marketplace, not an afterthought.

⸻

1. Batch desirability ranking engine

Some batches of Aventus, JPG Ultra Male, Dior Homme, La Nuit, etc. are worth more.

2. Insurance partnership

Offer optional $3 shipping insurance.

3. Decant-friendly profiles

Add “I include decants to balance a deal”.

4. Condition Grade AI

AI detects:
	•	scratches

To offer “try before you buy” bundles.

⸻

Exit Opportunities (You could sell this app)

A fragrance community app with AI capabilities is sellable to:
	•	Mecca
	•	Sephora
	•	Libertine
	•	Priceline
	•	Catch
	•	Niche fragrance boutiques
	•	Private fragrance resellers
	•	Startup acquirers

Valuation formula for a marketplace SaaS is usually:

10× monthly recurring revenue + 1× annual transactional revenue

Meaning if you’re at $20k MRR, your valuation could be ~$200k–300k. If it grows to $80k MRR, valuation could exceed $1M.
