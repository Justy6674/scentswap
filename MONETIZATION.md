## 🔮 Future Vision

**ScentSwap's fragrance database becomes the Bloomberg of the beauty industry** - the definitive source for fragrance intelligence, powering everything from retail experiences to AI recommendation engines across the global luxury market.

The database transforms from a supporting asset for ScentSwap's trading platform into the primary revenue generator, potentially worth $50M+ as a standalone business within 5 years.

**Strategic Exit**: Acquisition by beauty conglomerate (L'Oréal, Estée Lauder, LVMH) or technology giant (Google, Amazon, Meta) seeking fragrance AI capabilities and market data.
